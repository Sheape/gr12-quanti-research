Diabetes is becoming increasingly widespread worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is the
fourth deadliest disease in the Philippines, with about 4 million adults
diagnosed with it. Today, it is considered to be the main public health
challenge worldwide, with its growth in recent years and its impact on our
health \parencite{cudis-2021}. Understanding the risk factors associated with it
can lead to a better understanding of what the public should focus on. The
importance of understanding the relationship between sleep quality and diabetes
could potentially lead to a solution to prevent diabetes in non-diabetic people.


The objective of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between
sleep quality and blood sugar levels in diabetic patients and non-diabetic
patients in Angeles City, Pampanga, during the Academic Year 2022-2023. This
study seeks to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can sleep quality affect the risk of a person getting diabetes?
    \item What is the most optimal sleeping habit in order to reduce blood sugar
level?
    \item How can sleep disorders intensify the effects of diabetes?
\end{enumerate}
