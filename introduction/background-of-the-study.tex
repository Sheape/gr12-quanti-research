Diabetes is a chronic disease that arises from a lack of insulin, a hormone
produced by the pancreas to control blood production, or by the body's inability
to properly utilize insulin. Diabetes considerably worsens or causes heart
attacks, strokes, kidney issues, and lower limb amputation. The two types of
chronic diabetes are type 1 and type 2 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2022).
