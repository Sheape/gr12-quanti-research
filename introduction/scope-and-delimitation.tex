This study will primarily focus on determining the relationship between sleep
quality and blood sugar levels in Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes (T1DM \& T2DM)
patients. The study will cover the impact of sleep quality, disorders, and
habits on the blood sugar level of diabetic patients in Angeles City, Pampanga,
which will be conducted during the Academic Year 2023-2024.

The respondents of the study will be composed of diabetic (DM) patients from
Angeles City, Pampanga, located in Region III, Philippines. In particular, the
respondents will be between 18 and 60 years old. Angeles City was chosen as the
location for this study for convenience of the researchers.

The data collection will be performed through an online structured survey using
Google Forms. Some respondents may request that the researchers conduct it in a
face-to-face setting, as some elders prefer it and some are not knowledgeable
enough when interacting with technology. The structured survey will mostly be
based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to determine the sleep
quality of diabetes patients \parencite{xu-2019}. The researchers will collect
data in a 2-week interval from October 2023 to December 2023.
