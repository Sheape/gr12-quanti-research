This study will primarily focus on the determining the relationship between
sleep quality and blood sugar level of Type-1 and Type-2 diabetes (T1DM \& T2DM)
patients. The study will cover the impact of sleep quality, disorders and habits
on the blood sugar level of diabetic patients in Angeles City, Pampanga which is
conducted during the Academic Year 2023-2024.

The respondents of the study will be composed of diabetic (DM) patients from
Angeles City, Pampanga located in Region III Philippines. Particularly, the
respondents will be from ages 18-60 years old. Angeles City was chosen as the
location for this study for the convenience of the researchers.

The data collection will be performed through an online structured survey using
Google Forms. Some respondents may request the researchers to conduct it in a
face-to-face setting as some elderies prefer it and also for the reason that
they are not knowledgable in interacting with technology. The structured survey
will mostly be based on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to determine the
sleep quality \parencite{xu-2019}. The researchers will collect data in a 2-week
interval from October 2023 to December 2023.
